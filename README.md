This Repository contains the code for the Quantatitative Text Analysis Course. 

The Data and Code has been downloaded from various notebooks created in the TDM studio virtual machine. 

- The Get-Data folder contains the notebooks for the creation of the initial 95k articles about companies. It consists of 3 "_comparing.csv" (data annotated in doccano), a "Companies.csv" and "keywords.csv" (used to filter) and the final notebook (QTA_GetData) as Jupyter Notebook and as printed HTML.

- The SUBMISSION.ipynb includes the all the plots for the descriptive statistics and the calculation/plotting of the severity score (loads the FINAL_DATASET_FIX.csv, which are the 95k+ articles about companies, and the Stock_FINAL.xlsx, which are the stock prices). It also includes the Machine Learning improvement (this uses the ScandalsRevised.csv).
